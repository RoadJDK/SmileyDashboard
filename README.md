# SmileyDashboard

Hello .-.

You know, TCP is cool, so is coding.

I am trying to make something cool (and maybe useful) with it.

I don't care about CleanCode in my own projects. So don't expect that you can understand everything.

# How this will work?

I want to try a new learning method.

## Procedure
I don't know if the method has a name or something, but it goes like this:

* make a crapy prototype
* when I am stuck, I erase mostly
* make a second prototype
* when I am stuck, I erase mostly
* ...

I think you got it.

## Versions
I wanna do something like this:

* Prototype 1 MMwWWn
* Prototype 2 MMwWWn
* Prototype 3 MMwWWn
* Prototype ... MMwWWn
* Pre-Alpha 0.0.1pa
* Alpha 0.1.0a
* Beta  0.1.0b
* Release candidate	1.0.0c
* Release 1.0.0
* Post-release fixes / features  1.1.0
* Post-release fixes 1.1.1

**CURRENT VERSION: Prototype 2**
