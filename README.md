# SmileyDashboard

Hello .-.

You know, TCP is cool, so is coding.

I am trying to make something cool (and maybe useful) with it.

I don't care about CleanCode in my own projects. So don't expect that you can understand everything.

## How this will work?

I want to try a new learning method.

I don't know if the method has a name or something, but it goes like this:

* make a crapy prototype
* when I am stuck, I erase mostly
* make a second prototype
* when I am stuck, I erase mostly
* ...

I think you got it.

I wanna do something like this:

* Prototype 1
* Prototype 2
* Prototype 3
* Prototype ...
* Pre-Alpha
* Alpha
* Beta
* Release candidate	
* Release
* Post-release fixes

This Readme is WIP :^) 

Keep smiling :^)
